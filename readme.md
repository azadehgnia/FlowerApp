 a complete minimal Flask app that handles:

Simple authentication (username/password, session-based for example)
Uploading a flower name and picture
Saving picture to Azure Blob Storage
Storing name, image URL, user info in Azure PostgreSQL

You'll need to configure:
Azure Postgres connection
Azure Blob Storage connection
Your own Flask secret key


Explanation:

app.py: Your main Flask app code.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies list.
templates/: HTML templates folder.
login.html: Login form.
dashboard.html: Upload form & flower listing for the logged-in user.
static/: (Optional) Any custom CSS/JS (Flask serves files in here at /static/.)


The static folder in a Flask app is where you put any static files (files that don't change on the server), such as:

CSS files: (for styling your pages)
JavaScript files: (if you add client-side scripting)
Images: (if you want to include logo or other images not uploaded by users)
Fonts or other static resources.

Typical structure:

static/  
├── css/  
│   └── style.css  
├── js/  
│   └── script.js  
└── images/  
    └── logo.png  
 
So for your flower app, you might start with:


static/  
└── css/  
    └── style.css  
 
And then link your stylesheets in your HTML templates like this:


<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}"> 



## Changes to UX
To see (preview) and update (improve) the user experience (UX) of your Flask app:
 

1. See (Preview) Your UX
 

Run your app locally:

flask run  
or

python app.py  
 

Visit in your browser:
Open http://localhost:5000 or 8000
Login with your test credentials.
Try uploading a flower as a test.
 

2. Update (Improve) Your UX
 

Update HTML/CSS
 

Edit your templates/login.html and dashboard.html to change content, layout, form fields, etc.
Edit static/css/style.css (add this file if needed) to improve visuals.

Tips for improvements:
Use headings, spacing, and modern input styles.
Add feedback when uploads succeed/fail (you can use Flask flash() for this).
Use Bootstrap or another CSS framework to quickly make things look better.
Example: Add Bootstrap for a quick facelift
 

1. Edit your templates to add Bootstrap CDN:
 


<!-- Add this in <head> of your HTML -->  
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">  
 

2. Use Bootstrap classes
 


<form class="mb-3" ...>  
  <div class="mb-2">  
    <label for="username" class="form-label">Username</label>  
    <input type="text" class="form-control" ... >  
  </div>  
  ...  
</form>  
 

3. Update style.css (in static/css/) for extra tweaks
 
You can put custom styles here for background color, padding, etc.
 

3. Refresh Browser
 
Each time you save your template or static files, refresh your browser to see the changes.
 

Summary of Workflow
 

Change the relevant HTML in the templates/ folder for layout/content.
Change CSS in static/css/style.css for design/styling.
(Optional) Use Bootstrap or another framework for quick, attractive styles.
Run your Flask app, visit http://localhost:5000, and refresh as you make changes.
Iterate—improve based on your vision and feedback from users or yourself!

## How to handle secrets and keys

You should never hard-code sensitive information (like secret keys, database credentials, API keys, or storage account secrets) directly in your code or templates.

Instead, follow these best practices:
 

1. Use Environment Variables
 
Store your secrets as environment variables on your development machine and in your production environment (like Azure App Service).

Example in your local environment:


export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"  
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your-blob-conn-string"  
export DATABASE_URL="your-postgres-url"  
 
Access them in Python using os.environ:


import os  
  
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")  
STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = os.environ.get("AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING")  
DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")  
 
 

2. Use a .env File (for local development)
 
You can use a .env text file and a package like python-dotenv to load environment variables automatically.

Create a file called .env:


SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key  
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your-blob-conn-string  
DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-url  
 
Then in your app:


from dotenv import load_dotenv  
load_dotenv()  
  
import os  
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")  
 
 

3. In Azure
 

Azure App Service: Set secrets as Application Settings in the Azure Portal (Configuration > Application settings). These are injected as environment variables.
 

4. Never Commit Secrets to Git
 

Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file.
